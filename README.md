# Naive Implementation of Moller-Plesset perturbation theory of the second order.
# MP2
# 1. Molecular Data pulled from pubchem in .sdf format. Converted to .gzmat with Avogadro.
# 2. Naive implementation of MP2 derived from https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/blob/master/Tutorials/05_Moller-Plesset/5a_conventional-mp2.ipynb, with alterations to allow for reading input files. (To Do)
# 3. Make utility for tracking compute time? Or is this already save somewhere? (To Do)
# 3. Libraries for ML utilized to parallelize tensor math. (To Do)
# 4. Reimplementation of code in Bend language (To do)
# 5. Format memory to read only pertinent integrals as needed (To Do)
